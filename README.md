## Overview

**Engineering** is a widely pursued field driven by passion, influence, and necessity. **B2E (Back Bench Engineers)** addresses the unique struggles faced by students who often engage in last-minute exam preparation. Our application is specifically designed to assist students with their urgent study needs, providing targeted resources for effective last-minute revision.

The platform offers comprehensive study materials, including question banks and revision sets, tailored to various levels of learners—whether they need extensive coverage or focused review. We’ve developed these resources based on thorough analysis of examination patterns and our own successful strategies from college.

Additionally, B2E provides links to current courses and certifications, with daily updates and notifications to keep students informed and engaged. What sets us apart is our commitment to offering the most up-to-date study materials that align with changing syllabi and university norms. By ensuring that our content is continuously updated after each batch, we address a gap in the availability of relevant and current educational resources.
